## Cheatsheet

#### Registers
**AC**, a 16-bit accumulator<br>
**IR**, a 16-bit register which holds an instruction immediately preceding its execution.<br>
**MBR**, a 16-bit register that holds the data after its retrieval from, or before its placement into memory.<br>
**PC**, a 12-bit register that holds the address of the next program instruction to be executed.<br>
**MAR**, a 12-bit register that holds a memory address of an instruction or the operand of an instruction.<br>
**InREG**, an 8-bit register that holds data read from an input device.<br>
**OutREG**, an 8-bit register that holds data that is ready for the output device<br>
